# Project03 Computing Solutions

## 📌 Project Overview
This project addressed performance limitations in a class scheduling system caused by an underpowered Amazon EC2 instance.  
The goal was to upgrade its compute capacity to ensure smooth operation of the scheduling algorithm and support future feature expansion.

## 🚀 Key Features & Services
- **Amazon EC2** – Scalable virtual servers in the cloud.  
- **Instance Type Upgrade** – Increased compute and memory by resizing the EC2 instance.

## 📊 Lessons Learned
- Upgrading EC2 instance types provides a quick and effective performance boost.  
- AWS allows seamless vertical scaling without having to recreate resources.  
- Always **stop** the instance before changing its type to avoid errors.  
- Monitoring performance helps determine the right balance between cost and compute power.
