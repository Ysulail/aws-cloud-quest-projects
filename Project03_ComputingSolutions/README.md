# Project03 Computing Solutions

## 📌 Project Overview
This project addressed performance limitations in a class scheduling system caused by underpowered Amazon EC2 instances.  
The goal was to **upgrade the compute capacity** of the EC2 instance to ensure smooth operation of the scheduling algorithm and support future feature expansion.

## 🚀 Key Features & Services
- **Amazon EC2** – Scalable virtual servers in the cloud.  
- **Instance Type Upgrade** – Increased compute and memory by resizing the EC2 instance.

## 📊 Lessons Learned
- Upgrading EC2 instance types provides a quick and effective performance boost.  
- AWS allows seamless vertical scaling without having to recreate resources.  
- Always **stop** the instance before changing its type to avoid errors.  
- Monitoring performance helps determine the right balance between cost and compute power.
