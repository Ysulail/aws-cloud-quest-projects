# Project01 Cloud Computing Essentials


## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
In this project, I helped a coastal city's IT team migrate their wave-size forecast webpage from a traditional data center to the AWS cloud.  
The goal was to reduce infrastructure delays and increase reliability by hosting the static website on **Amazon S3** instead of managing physical servers.

## ðŸš€ Key Features & Services
- **Amazon S3**: Used to host a static website containing the city's wave forecast page.  
- **S3 Static Website Hosting**: Enabled to serve HTML content publicly via S3.
- **Bucket Policy**: Configured to allow public access to the static website content stored in Amazon S3.

## ðŸ“Š Lessons Learned
- Hosting static content on Amazon S3 eliminates the need to manage servers.  
- Amazon S3 provides **high availability and durability** by default.  
- Applying a **bucket policy** helps control access to content securely and publicly when needed.  
- The move to AWS significantly **reduces setup time and cost** compared to traditional infrastructure.
