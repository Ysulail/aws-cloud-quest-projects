# Project06 Connecting VPCs

## 📌 Project Overview
In this project, I worked on connecting different departments in the organization by enabling communication between their VPCs. This helped the teams access shared data more easily and improved productivity.

## 🚀 Key Features & Services
- **Amazon VPC Peering** to connect isolated networks between departments.
- **Amazon EC2 Instances** to host workloads inside each VPC.
- **Route Tables Configuration** to enable inter-VPC communication.
- **EC2 Instance Connect** to access EC2 instances directly through the browser.
- **Session Manager** to connect securely without opening inbound ports.
- **SSH Client** to establish terminal-based remote access to EC2 instances.
- **EC2 Serial Console** to troubleshoot boot and network issues directly.
