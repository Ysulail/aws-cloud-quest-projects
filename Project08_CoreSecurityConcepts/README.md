# Project08 Core Security Concepts

## 📌 Project Overview
In this project, I helped an insurance company manage access control by implementing security best practices using **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)**. The goal was to provide consistent permissions for the Support Engineering team by creating an IAM group and assigning managed read-only policies to streamline access while applying the **least privilege principle**.

## 🚀 Key Features & Services
- **IAM Groups** to manage permissions for multiple users collectively.  
- **IAM Users** to grant individuals access to AWS services.  
- **Managed Policies** for read-only access to **Amazon EC2** and **Amazon RDS**.  
- **Permission Inheritance** through group-based access control.

## 📊 Lessons Learned
- IAM groups simplify user management by centralizing permission assignments.  
- AWS managed policies accelerate setup and align with security best practices.  
- Group-based access ensures scalability and enforces consistent permissions.  
- Applying the least privilege principle reduces unnecessary access risks.
