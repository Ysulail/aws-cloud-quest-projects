# AWS Cloud Quest – Cloud Practitioner Projects

This repository documents my hands-on journey through the AWS Cloud Quest: Cloud Practitioner badge.

Each project simulates a real-world scenario where I applied different AWS services to solve technical problems across cloud computing, networking, databases, scalability, security, and more.

All 12 projects are listed below, each with its own folder containing a detailed breakdown of the solution, services used, key learnings, and screenshots.

## About the Challenge

- Badge: AWS Cloud Quest – Cloud Practitioner  
- Format: 12 real-life projects  
- Skills: EC2, S3, RDS, IAM, Auto Scaling, Load Balancers, VPC, EFS, DynamoDB, and more  
- Tools Used: AWS Console, GitHub, Markdown, Screenshots

Each project helped me build foundational cloud skills and understand how AWS services are applied in practice.

## What's Next?

I'm currently exploring more AWS Quest badges (like Solutions Architect), and building real-world cloud projects to continue leveling up.

Stay tuned!
