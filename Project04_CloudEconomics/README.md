# Project04 Cloud Economics

## 📌 Project Overview
In this project, I helped a local surf shop estimate their cloud infrastructure cost using the **AWS Pricing Calculator**.  
The goal was to optimize server usage based on peak hours and reduce unnecessary spending by leveraging AWS's pay-as-you-go model.

## 🚀 Key Features & Services
- **AWS Pricing Calculator**: Built a custom estimate simulating current architecture.
- **Cost Analysis**: Evaluated on-demand EC2 instance usage across variable workloads.
- **Snapshot & Storage Costs**: Accounted for EBS and snapshot expenses.
- **Data Transfer Pricing**: Included outbound internet traffic cost estimates.
- **Cost Breakdown**:
  - **Total Monthly Cost**: ~$8,050.69
  - **Annual Estimate**: ~$96,608.28
  - **EBS Snapshot Cost**: $2.75/month
  - **Data Transfer Cost**: ~$7,987.20/month

## 📊 Lessons Learned
- **AWS Pricing Calculator** helped estimate infrastructure costs more accurately before deployment.
- **Modeling On-Demand usage** using EC2 instance hours gave better visibility into cost fluctuations across weekdays and weekends.
- **Calculating snapshot and EBS storage costs** showed how AWS separates storage and compute for granular billing.
- **Understanding outbound data transfer tiers** helped estimate bandwidth-related costs more precisely for high-traffic applications.
