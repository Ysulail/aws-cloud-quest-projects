# Project02 Cloud First Steps

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
In this project, I supported the emergency response team of a fictional island by migrating a critical computational system from a failing on-premises server to the cloud using **Amazon EC2**. The goal was to increase system resilience and fault tolerance by deploying virtual servers across multiple Availability Zones.


## ðŸš€ Key Features & Services
- **Amazon EC2** â€“ Launching and managing virtual servers
- **Key Pairs** â€“ Secure authentication for SSH access
- **Security Groups** â€“ Firewall rules to control traffic

## ðŸ“Š Lessons Learned
- Deploying EC2 instances across multiple AZs improves application resilience and availability.  
- Cloud-based infrastructure enables rapid recovery from hardware failures without waiting for physical replacements.  
- Availability Zones are isolated but interconnected, offering a strong foundation for fault-tolerant designs.
