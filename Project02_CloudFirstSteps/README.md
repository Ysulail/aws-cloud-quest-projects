# Project02 Cloud First Steps

## 📌 Project Overview
In this project, I supported the emergency response team of a fictional island by migrating a critical computational system from a failing on-premises server to the cloud using **Amazon EC2**.  
**The goal was to increase system resilience and fault tolerance by deploying virtual servers across multiple Availability Zones.**


## 🚀 Key Features & Services
- **Amazon EC2** – Launching and managing virtual servers
- **Key Pairs** – Secure authentication for SSH access
- **Security Groups** – Firewall rules to control traffic

## 🖥️ Application in Action

## 📊 Lessons Learned
- Gained hands-on experience launching and accessing an EC2 instance
- Learned how to securely connect using key pairs
- Understood how to configure security groups to manage instance access
